# Data_Visualization

Loan data from Prosper, a peer-to-peer lending marketplace, is analyzed using Python visualization tools, including matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn libraries. The goal of this analysis is to gain insight into factors that affect loan repayment status, borrower rate, and number of investors.

This analysis is done to fulfill the requirements for the Data Visualization course in Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree program.
